            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Hello, I go by Blessed or Bless and I am a confident and ambitious individual. I aspire to study Computer Science in my future, and continously build on my skills through freelance projects such as websites (such as this one), applications, games and much more. I am passionate about what I am currently able to do, and I pray I'll be able to do much more in the future! When it comes to careers, I wish to be a (Conteractor for) Machine Learning/AI Engineer or even a (Entrepreneur in) Robotics Engineer! I am determined to make my aspirations come true.</p>

                        <p>In Summer of 2023, I had gotten the chance to be a Sales Assistant in Sports Direct.

This job allowed me to really build on my customer service skills, as well as experience what it is to be in industry and deal with the rush. It taught me to disicpline myself as well, when it came to following rules and regulations. A job that was really helpful, and I am grateful for.</p>
